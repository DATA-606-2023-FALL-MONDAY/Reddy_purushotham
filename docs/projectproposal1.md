# Problem Statement of the Project

Landslides are a major problem during the monsoon period in many parts of Uttarakhand. The most affected is the communication interface, which is disturbed due to landslides, immobilizing daily and routine life. 
The primary objective of this exploration is to understand, oversee, control, monitor, and prevent the colossal impact these catastrophes bring to human life. Typically, these landslides occur within minutes after
an earthquake activation, hours to days after the activation of snowmelt, and days to weeks after the activation of severe precipitation.

A comprehensive risk management strategy is therefore needed to reduce the extent of the disaster. The appropriate option is that within the framework of sustainable disaster risk management, the installation of an 
early warning system is generally a cost-effective risk mitigation measure. Landslide instrumentation and real-time monitoring provide understanding of the dynamics of landslide movement. Moreover, landslide monitoring 
progressively can provide prompt data on landslide activity that may be critical to securing lives and properties. Reliable landslide warning systems, the result of systematic landslide instrumentation and real-time
monitoring, require a precise short-term forecast of landslide movement, which in turn requires a detailed understanding of current field weather conditions and a quantitative framework to interpret these conditions.



## Overview of Adopted Methodology

The investigations of landslides that have been conducted from quite a while ago until recently have shown that one of the most crucial factors contributing to landslides is precipitation data.
Early studies on rainfall intensities and durations associated with shallow landslides were carried out by Caine [2]. Various researchers who published their previous studies speculated that the impact of 
precipitation in triggering shallow landslides and debris flow activity is evident but difficult to define precisely.

This difficulty arises because rainfall only influences slope stability indirectly, through its effect on pore water pressure conditions in the slope material and because it requires interaction with other characteristics
of the waste mantle. Extreme rainfall conditions, when intensities remain high for long periods of time, must be accurately examined. In this case, any soil could become unstable. Thus, a better understanding of the 
intensity and duration of rainfall events is necessary to comprehend their association with soil slope initiation and to establish various warning thresholds.

Landslide event forecasting is not only a key risk goal for managers but also a test of how well the process is understood. Landslides can be estimated in various ways.
Detection of landslide susceptibility from a spatial perspective is the most common approach. Since the Caine studies, data have been collected at various sites on the conditions of rainfall intensity-duration that result 
in slope failures, and different rainfall thresholds of rainfall intensity-duration (ID) have been proposed at local, regional, and global scales. Landslides caused by rainfall often result in significant damage to people 
living nearby, property, and infrastructure. To analyze the primary causes of landslides, many studies have developed rainfall thresholds for landslide initiation using either an empirical or physical model.


# Input Data

The landslide database for this project was collected from the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC), Global Fatal Landslide Database, and a few other news websites.

## Global Landslide Catalog (GLC)

The NASA Global Landslide Catalog is the largest openly available global inventory of rainfall-triggered mass movements known to date. The inventory was created at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and currently contains more than 11,000 reports on landslides, debris flows, rock landslides, etc. around the world. Landslide reports are primarily found from online media, including news articles and other databases. Scientists, interns, and other NASA GSFC colleagues compiled the GLC. It is now a part of the Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR's) vast inventory that also contains citizen science data and, in the future, other landslide inventories.

## Global Fatal Landslide Database (GFLD)

The GFLD (formerly known as the Durham Fatal Landslide Database) was compiled using English-language-based systematic metadata search tools that identify relevant daily reports of landslides activity. Mass media reports, together with other hazard databases, provide the first alert for the occurrence and impact of fatal landslides. Reports are validated and information updated by source triangulation using government and aid agency reports, academic papers, and personal communications, as new data becomes available. The dataset has been consistently collected and managed since 2004, following a period of methodological development between September 2002 and December 2003.

The reliability of reporting, based on the robustness of regional communications networks considered more consistent in developed countries, is also spatially variable and sometimes political (e.g., there are very few landslides in North Korea). The database has been compiled since 2004 to include the date of occurrence; the description of the location of the landslide; the approximate latitude and longitude for that location; the countries and geographical regions where the landslide occurred; the number of fatalities and injuries; and whether the event was caused by rainfall, seismicity (the occurrence or frequency of earthquakes in a region).

## Rainfall Database

The rainfall database for the study area region was collected from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).

### Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)

A joint task between NASA and the agency for Japan Aerospace Exploration (JAXA) to investigate rainfall for meteorology and climate research is the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). On April 15, 2015, the TRMM satellite finished gathering data. The TRMM satellite was propelled toward the finish of November 1997 with a plan life of three years, creating important logical data for over 17 years. TRMM carried 5 instruments: a 3-sensor rainfall suite and 2 related instruments.

TRMM supplied a unique, 17-year global rain and lightning dataset. The TRMM dataset turned into the space standard for estimating precipitation and prompted research that improved our comprehension of tropical violent wind structure and advancement, convective framework properties, lightning-storm connections, atmosphere and climate modeling, and human impacts on precipitation. The data also supported operational applications such as flood and drought monitoring and weather forecasting.

# Landslide Data

The data was collected for the study area region i.e., Rudraprayag to Joshimath. There were numerous landslides normally occurring from June to September. We had a list of 67 landslide events in this historical catalog, which was known precisely when the landslide took place. 63 landslides from 2010 to 2018, while other landslides in 2007 and 2008 (as shown in Figure 1.2).

Most of the landslides occurred in July with 29 events, and next with August with 13 events and June with 9 events and September with 8 events and rest with a small fraction of rest of months (as shown in Figure 1.3). Investigation of the landslide database demonstrates that the majority of the landslides in the database were caused by precipitation into the soil, causing an increase in soil pore-water pressure.
