## 2. Background

### What is it about?
This research project aims to comprehensively understand and mitigate the risks associated with landslides in Uttarakhand, particularly during the monsoon period.

### Why does it matter?
Landslides during the monsoon season disrupt daily life and communication infrastructure in Uttarakhand. It's crucial to address this issue to safeguard lives and properties.

### Research Questions
- What are the primary causes of landslides in Uttarakhand?
- How can we effectively monitor and predict landslide events?

## 3. Data

### Data Sources
- Global Landslide Catalog (GLC)
- Global Fatal Landslide Database (GFLD)
- Rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)

### Data Details
- Data Size: Varies (GLC has over 11,000 reports)
- Data Shape: Varies (e.g., GLC contains various types of landslide reports)
- Time Period: Historical data of 15 years
- Each row represents: Details of landslide events (location, date, type)
- Data Dictionary:
  - Columns Name
  - Data Type
  - Definition
  - Potential Values (for categorical variables)
- Target/Label Variable: Type of landslide event
- Feature/Predictor Variables: Various meteorological and geographical factors

This proposal provides a structured approach to understanding and mitigating landslides in Uttarakhand, backed by comprehensive data analysis and research.
